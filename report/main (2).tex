This report presents a comprehensive study on the application of machine learning techniques to improve facial recognition using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The challenges of high dimensionality and class imbalance inherent in facial recognition are addressed through innovative feature extraction methods and dimensionality reduction techniques. Our investigation employs a combination of Pre-trained ResNet, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to effectively balance data representativeness and computational efficiency.

The major findings of our research reveal significant insights into the performance trade-offs among various feature-classifier combinations. These insights are crucial for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of facial recognition systems in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the configurations that most effectively optimize both performance and computational resources.

	\section{Approaches Tried}
	
	In our study, we investigated several machine learning models to enhance facial recognition performance using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Our objective was to determine the effectiveness of various feature extraction techniques and classification models.

\subsection*{Feature Extraction Methods}

We employed three distinct methods to extract features from the images:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pre-trained ResNet Features\cite{resnet}:} Utilizing a pre-trained ResNet model, we extracted high-level features from the images, resulting in a 2048-dimensional feature vector per image. This approach leverages deep learning to capture intricate patterns and characteristics of faces.
    \item \textbf{Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)\cite{hog}:} The HOG feature descriptor was used to capture edge and gradient structure information from the images, producing a 70,308-dimensional vector. This method is traditionally renowned for its effectiveness in object detection tasks.
    \item \textbf{Local Binary Patterns (LBP)\cite{lbp}:} We extracted texture features using the LBP technique, which provided a 256-dimensional feature vector per image. LBP is particularly useful for capturing fine-grained texture details that are often pivotal in facial recognition.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Dimensionality Reduction with PCA}

Given the high dimensionality of the extracted features, especially from the ResNet and HOG methods, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \cite{PCA} to reduce the feature dimensions. This step was crucial to alleviate computational demands and to standardize the feature space across different methods for a fair comparison of model performances. PCA was tailored for each feature type, ensuring optimal dimension reduction while retaining significant variance in the data.

\subsection*{Classification Models}

We experimented with the following classification models on the dimensionally reduced features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\cite{knn}:} A simple yet effective model that classifies images based on the closest feature vectors in the training set.
    \item \textbf{Logistic Regression:} A fundamental statistical model used to estimate probabilities using a logistic function, ideal for binary classification tasks.
    \item \textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM)\cite{svm}:} This model finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space, which is critical in high-dimensional spaces.
    \item \textbf{Random Forest\cite{randomforest}:} An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and control over-fitting.
    \item \textbf{XGBoost\cite{xgboost}:} An implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance, which has proven effective in various machine learning competitions.
\end{itemize}

Each model was applied to the PCA-reduced features from the three extraction methods, and performance metrics were calculated to evaluate their efficacy in facial recognition tasks.We also experimented with the balanced version of Logistic Regression to address the significant class imbalance, but it incurred high computational costs without consistently improving the results. Consequently, we excluded it from the analysis table.

	\section{Experiments and Results}


\subsection*{Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset Overview}
The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) \cite{Huang2012a} dataset is a key resource in computer vision, particularly valuable for the development and evaluation of face recognition technologies. The dataset comprises:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Images:} Color photographs typically sized around 250x250 pixels, focusing on the face of individuals.
    \item \textbf{Number of Classes:} The dataset includes images of 5,749 different individuals, constituting a vast multi-class space.
    \item \textbf{Class Imbalance:} There is significant class imbalance, with some individuals represented by many images and others by very few.
\end{itemize}

This dataset poses substantial challenges such as high dimensionality of raw pixel data, the need for robust feature extraction to manage intra-class variation, and sophisticated machine learning techniques to address the significant class imbalance.

\subsection*{Experimental Setup and Model Parameterization}
\subsubsection*{Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction}
To manage the high dimensionality of the face images and the expansive class space effectively, we applied the following feature extraction methods followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pre-trained ResNet Features
    \item Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
    \item Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
\end{itemize}

PCA was performed with dimensions of \textbf{32}, \textbf{64}, and \textbf{128} to find a balance between retaining essential features and reducing dimensionality for computational efficiency.

\subsubsection*{Classification Models and Parameters}
We utilized several classification models with specific configurations to efficiently process the data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):} Configured with 5 neighbors to make the model sensitive enough to effectively capture the nuances between different faces, crucial given the high variability within the 5,749 classes.
    \item \textbf{Logistic Regression:} Using the `saga` solver, `L2` penalty, tolerance of 0.01, and up to 1000 iterations, these settings ensure the solver converges on a solution within a reasonable timeframe without sacrificing the accuracy needed to handle many classes.
    \item \textbf{SVM (LinearSVC):} Set with a regularization parameter \(C = 1\) and a maximum of 1000 iterations, optimizing for linear separability and managing the high dimensionality post-PCA reduction.
    \item \textbf{Random Forest:} 10 estimators, a max depth of 20, and `max features` set to `sqrt` to keep the model's complexity in check and prevent overfitting by considering a sufficient number of features at each split.
    \item \textbf{XGBoost:} 20 estimators and a max depth of 20, these settings offer a good trade-off between model complexity and learning ability, crucial in a dataset with a large number of classes.
\end{itemize}

Parameters not specifically mentioned were set to their default values in the scikit-learn library. This approach is designed to provide a thorough comparison across different feature extraction methods and model configurations, identifying the most effective techniques for facial recognition with the LFW dataset.

    \item SVM and Logistic Regression generally provided the highest accuracies with ResNet and HOG features, whereas SVM's performance plummeted with LBP features. This suggests a need for feature extraction methods that better align with SVM’s capabilities. A notable observation not depicted in the analysis table is that despite its prolonged convergence time across all scenarios, SVM consistently delivered superior outcomes when paired with ResNet and HOG features.


\item One of the key challenges in the LFW dataset is the significant imbalance among classes, with some classes having many more samples than others. SVM's effectiveness in this context can be attributed to its margin optimization, which focuses on correctly classifying the most challenging examples near the decision boundary rather than merely optimizing overall accuracy. This characteristic allows SVM to perform well even when some classes are underrepresented.

    \item KNN showed excellent retrieval capabilities (Top-5 accuracy) but needs enhancements for precision in Top-1 rankings, possibly through method modifications or integrating different feature types. This discrepancy suggests that KNN can effectively retrieve groups of similar classes, but struggles with precisely identifying the most probable class. It indicates the model's sensitivity to the local structure of data where neighbors include the correct class but not as the closest match. This could be due to the vast and diverse class space where similar features may exist among different faces, thus confusing the model in precise ranking. Enhancing KNN's precision might require method modifications such as implementing distance weighting or incorporating additional or more discriminative feature types
    \item The choice of feature extraction methods and classifier combinations is critical in complex datasets, particularly those involving high dimensionality and class variability like facial recognition.
        \item The performance of XGBoost was consistently lower than other models, particularly in environments with high-dimensional data and large class spaces. This contradicts the expectations set by its gradient boosting capabilities, indicating that in this specific dataset, XGBoost may not effectively handle the complexity or the class imbalance as previously theorized.
     \item 
LBP features proved to be insufficiently discriminative for SVM classification, resulting in lengthy training times exceeding 14 hours and yielding low accuracy. This indicates the need for more complex or diverse features to improve model performance.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Performance Metrics for SVM}

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier demonstrated consistently high accuracy in our experiments, particularly when paired with robust feature extraction methods like ResNet and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Below, we present the precision, recall, and F1-score for SVM in the context of these feature extraction techniques. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the classifier in a multiclass setting.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Feature Method} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F1-Score} \\
\hline
ResNet & 0.96 & 0.98 & 0.97 \\
\hline
HOG & 0.99 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Precision, Recall, and F1-score for SVM using ResNet and HOG features.}
\label{tab:svm_metrics}
\end{table}

\textbf{Multiclass Formulation of Precision, Recall, and F1-Score}

In a multiclass classification context, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated for each class individually and then averaged to provide a global performance metric. The definitions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precision} (Positive Predictive Value): The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives for a specific class.
    \item \textbf{Recall} (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives for a specific class.
    \item \textbf{F1-Score}: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. It is particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.
\end{itemize}

Mathematically, for a specific class \( i \):

\begin{equation}
    \text{Precision}_i = \frac{TP_i}{TP_i + FP_i}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \text{Recall}_i = \frac{TP_i}{TP_i + FN_i}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \text{F1-Score}_i = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision}_i \cdot \text{Recall}_i}{\text{Precision}_i + \text{Recall}_i}
\end{equation}

Where \( TP_i \) is the number of true positives, \( FP_i \) is the number of false positives, and \( FN_i \) is the number of false negatives for class \( i \).

\section{Summary}

This report investigates the application of advanced machine learning techniques to enhance facial recognition capabilities using the \textit{Labeled Faces in the Wild} (LFW) dataset. We address the inherent challenges of high dimensionality and class imbalance through innovative feature extraction methods and dimensionality reduction techniques. Specifically, we utilize Pre-trained ResNet, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for feature extraction, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to achieve a balance between data representativeness and computational efficiency.

Our findings reveal significant insights into the performance trade-offs among various feature-classifier combinations, which are crucial for optimizing both accuracy and computational resources in real-world scenarios. The study highlights configurations that effectively enhance the performance of facial recognition systems. For example, the SVM classifier consistently outperforms other models when paired with ResNet and HOG features across different PCA dimensions, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness. Conversely, the performance of XGBoost is notably lower, suggesting that it may not handle the complexities and class imbalance of the dataset effectively.

The report contributes to the field by outlining effective strategies for managing large-scale, imbalanced datasets in facial recognition technologies. It provides a comprehensive analysis of how different combinations of feature extraction methods and classifiers can be optimized to improve the accuracy and reliability of facial recognition systems.
